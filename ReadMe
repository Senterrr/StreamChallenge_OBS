StreamChallenge OBS

A local tool to manage stream challenges (checklists, wheel of fortune, etc.) and show them in OBS through a browser source.

📦 Setup (first time only)
1. Install Node.js

Download & install the LTS version from nodejs.org
.

Verify installation in terminal:

node -v

2. Install dependencies

From the project folder, go into the ws-server folder and run:

cd ws-server
npm install

🚀 Launching
🪟 Windows

Double-click start.bat in the project root.

This will:

Start the local WebSocket server

Open the Controller in your default browser

🍎 macOS

Open Terminal and run:

cd path/to/StreamChallenge_OBS/ws-server
node server.js


Open controller.html in Chrome/Edge/Safari (just double-click it).

🎥 Add Overlay to OBS

In OBS → + → Browser

Check "Local file"

Select overlay.html from this project

Set width/height to match your canvas (e.g. 1920×1080)

🕹️ Usage

Controller (controller.html) → Off-stream control panel

Overlay (overlay.html) → The visual that shows in OBS

Both connect through the local WebSocket server (default: ws://127.0.0.1:17311).

🔧 Common Issues

Controller/Overlay says "Disconnected"

Make sure the server is running (start.bat on Windows, node server.js on Mac).

Allow Node.js through the firewall.

Overlay is blank in OBS

Ensure you checked Local file and selected overlay.html.

Channel names in Controller & Overlay must match (default: obs_challenge_overlay).

That’s it — just launch the server, open the Controller, and add the Overlay to OBS 🎉
